# Now

_Last updated: 17th Feb, 2024_

What am I up to? What's going on with me **now**?

## Â» Novice Woodworking

> I've recently been getting into [woodworking](/woodworking.html).

## Â» Building Side-Projects

> I've always got a side-project or two on the go. Currently, I'm launching a [Ruby on Rails Starter Kit](https://railsnotesui.xyz/starter-kit) and a tool to [share Amazon cart links](https://amzcartshare.com).

## Â» Blogging about Ruby on Rails

> I publish frequently on my [Ruby on Rails blog, RailsNotes ðŸŸ¥](https://railsnotes.xyz)
>
> RailsNotes is the blog I wish I had when I started learning Ruby on Rails â€” It's been great to give back to the Rails community, and I've been blown away by the reception!
>
> Alongside the main blog, I've also built [RailsNotes UI, Ruby on Rails templates and components](https://railsnotesui.xyz), the [better_mailer_previews gem](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/better_mailer_previews), the [RailsNotes newsletter](https://railsnotes.xyz/newsletter) and more!

## Â» Software Engineering at HotDoc

> I've found a great place to work at HotDoc â€” great people, great culture. Plus, they're a Rails shop!
