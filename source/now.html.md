| **Novice Woodworking**             | I've recently been getting into [woodworking](/woodworking.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Software Engineering at HotDoc** | I've found a great place to work at HotDoc — great people, great culture. Plus, they're a Rails shop!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Building Side-Projects**         | Currently, I'm: [Writing about dumbphones](https://dumbph.com), building an [affiliate link monitoring tool](https://affimon.com), creating a Chrome Extension to [Export your online shopping cart to a spreadsheet](https://cartexporter.com), and a method to [Turn a Google Doc into a website](https://voltdocs.com).                                         |
| **Blogging about Ruby on Rails**   | I write my [Ruby on Rails blog, RailsNotes 🟥](https://railsnotes.xyz). Alongside the blog, I've built [RailsNotes UI, Ruby on Rails templates and components](https://railsnotesui.xyz), the [better_mailer_previews gem](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/better_mailer_previews), the [RailsNotes newsletter](https://railsnotes.xyz/newsletter) and more. |
