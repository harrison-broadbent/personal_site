# Now

_Last updated: 12th January, 2024_

What am I up to? What's going on with me **now**?

## > Blogging about Ruby on Rails

> I publish frequently on my [Ruby on Rails blog, RailsNotes ðŸŸ¥](https://railsnotes.xyz)
>
> RailsNotes is the blog I wish I had when I started learning Ruby on Rails â€”Â It's been great to give back to the Rails community, and I've been blown away by the reception!
>
> Alongside the main blog, I've also built [RailsNotes UI, Ruby on Rails templates and components](https://railsnotesui.xyz), the [better_mailer_previews gem](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/better_mailer_previews), the [RailsNotes newsletter](https://railsnotes.xyz/newsletter) and more!

## > Software Engineering at HotDoc

> I've found a great place to work at HotDoc â€”Â great people, great culture. Plus, they're a Rails shop!
