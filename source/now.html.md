# Now

What am I up to?

Currently, I'm -

## > Blogging about Ruby on Rails

> I'm currently writing [Ruby on Rails guides at RailsNotes ðŸŸ¥](https://railsnotes.xyz)
>
> RailsNotes is a blog and newsletter, where I write the Ruby on Rails guides I wish I had when I was starting out.
>
> It's been great to give back to the Rails community, and I've been blown away by the great reception.

## > Embracing a tech layoff

> Yep, it happened to me too.
>
> 2023 has been a tough year for lots of tech workers, but I'm lucking to be in a position where I can enjoy some downtime rather than having to dive straight back into job hunting.
