# Now

What am I up to?

Currently, I'm -

## > Building a Micro-SaaS

> I'm currently working on [buybase](https://buybase.io), a SaaS to help indie creators sell access to their Airtable and Notion databases. Currently it's in a pretty heavy development phase, and on the side I'm trying to reach out to potential early users.

## > Working in software

> In January 2023, I started working full-time in software at Bukalapak, to help bring Indonesia's small businesses online.
