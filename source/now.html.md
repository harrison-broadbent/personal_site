# Now

What am I up to?

Currently, I'm -

## > Building a Micro-SaaS

> I'm currently working on [Jobly](https://jobly.so), a SaaS to help companies manage their recruiting and hiring with Notion. Currently it's in a pretty heavy development phase, and on the side I'm trying to reach out to potential early users.

## > Working at a medical startup

> Since June 2018 I've been working at [Seer Medical](https://seermedical.com), in a bit of a strange mix of manufacturing / production management / software engineering roles. Seer offers at-home EEG diagnostics for people who may have epilepsy.

> I enjoy the work, but the thing that has kept me there is the people. I've been lucky enough to work with some of the kindest, funniest, most hardworking people I've ever met.

## > Looking for work!

> As much as I love Seer, it looks like the next chapter of my life will take me elsewhere.

> I'm currently hunting for software engineering roles, primarily around Melbourne, Australia, but I'm pretty open minded. If you're interested in talking, please reach out by email â€” I'd love to chat!
