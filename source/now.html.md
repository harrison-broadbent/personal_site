What am I up to? What's going on with me **now**?

| **Novice Woodworking**             | I've recently been getting into [woodworking](/woodworking.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Building Side-Projects**         | I've always got a side-project or two on the go. Currently, I'm [writing about dumbphones](https://dumbph.com) and building a tool to [share Amazon cart links](https://amzcartshare.com).                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Blogging about Ruby on Rails**   | I publish frequently on my [Ruby on Rails blog, RailsNotes ðŸŸ¥](https://railsnotes.xyz). Alongside the blog, I've also built [RailsNotes UI, Ruby on Rails templates and components](https://railsnotesui.xyz), the [better_mailer_previews gem](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/better_mailer_previews), the [RailsNotes newsletter](https://railsnotes.xyz/newsletter) and more! |
| **Software Engineering at HotDoc** | I've found a great place to work at HotDoc â€” great people, great culture. Plus, they're a Rails shop!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
