You probably haven't heard of [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), a Ruby static site generator.

Middleman is a static site generator built atop Ruby, plain ERB templating, and Markdown content files. It compiles down to static assets which you can host for free using something like [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

I really like Middleman — I use it to host my personal site (this one), and it's great. It's flexible, performant, and far easier to context-switch between a Ruby on Rails app and a Middleman blog than any Javascript static site generator I've played around with.

If you're interested, I've open-sourced a [Ruby, Tailwind and Middleman blog template](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/ruby-middleman-tailwind-starter-blog). It's the template this site is based off, and it comes pre-configured with plenty of goodies like:

- Tailwind CSS setup & configured,
- Markdown rendering,
- Code blocks and syntax highlighting,
- Live reloading,
- Sitemap and RSS feeds,
- and more!

That's it — this article is more of a PSA than anything, but I wanted to share that this tool & template are available (although I'd love to re-invigorate development on Middleman, since it's now largely in maintenance mode).

If you're coming from Rails, you'll feel right at home, and you won't have to spin up a full Rails app just to host some markdown files.

Enjoy!
