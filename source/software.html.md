# Software

Some of the software projects I've built. You can visit my [Github](https://www.github.com/harrison-broadbent), or check out individual project by clicking their titles.

Please ⭐️ these projects if you find them useful, I really appreciate it!

### [JGen 📔](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/JGen)

> JGen is a Python script to generate text-based journal files from a template.

> Given a template, built using a set of simple templating options, JGen can generate a text-based journal of arbitrary length, automatically filling in dates, days of the year, weeks of the year etc.

> I find a simple text journal kept on my computer quite useful, and so I built JGen to help me generate templates for my journals. I added some extra functionality to make it more broadly useful.

> ⇒ _Python3, Regex_

### [Clipprs ✂️](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/clipprs)

> Clipprs is a piece of software I developed to track all the little bits of information that we collect about the people we meet.

> Rather than rely solely on our brains (which are very prone to forgetting), Clipprs provides a central repository to store and retrieve all that information.

> Clipprs was designed with speed and simplicity in mind, in particular it's focused on minimizing the friction between encountering some information, and entering it into your system.

> ⇒ _NodeJS, [Oclif](https://www.oclif.io), [Enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer)_

### [LibgenAPI](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/libgen-api)

> [Library Genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/) is a search engine for a wide collection of books and articles and enables free access to this content where it would otherwise be paywalled or inaccessible.

> As part of a project, I was looking to access results from Library Genesis using an API and then to manipulate that data using Python. Unfortunately, there was (and still is) [no 1st party API](http://garbage.world/posts/libgen/?ref=public-apis) methods for searching by titles or authors, and I had reliability issues with other open-source solutions. I had access to one of the largest "libraries" in the world, but had no reliable way of programmatically searching it!

> So, I decided to implement my own library for searching Library Genesis. It solves the core desire of wanting a simple was to searching Library Genesis for titles and authors. It is currently a [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/libgen-api/) and uses [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape and parse data from Library Genesis search results.

> ⇒ _Python3, [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)_

### [Personal Site](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/personal_site)

> My personal website was built using Middleman, a ruby-based static site generator, and a combination of ERB and Markdown templates.

> More details [here](stack).

> ⇒ _Ruby, [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), [ERB](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_template_erb.html), Markdown_
