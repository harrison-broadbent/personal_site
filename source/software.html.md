# Software

Some of the software projects I've built. You can visit my [Github](https://www.github.com/harrison-broadbent), or check out individual project by clicking their titles.

Please ⭐️ these projects if you find them useful, I really appreciate it!

### [AMZ Cart Share 🛒](https://amzcartshare.com)

> Once I launched my starter kit, I figured I should probably use it to build something!
>
> I've built AMZ Cart Share, a Chrome extension to [share Amazon cart links](https://amzcartshare.com) — Amazon has a little-known way of building links to add an entire collection of products to a cart at one time, which I think could be really handy.

> ⇒ Ruby on Rails, ViewComponents

### [RailsNotes UI 🔨](https://railsnotesui.xyz)

> RailsNotes UI is a library of [email templates and components for Ruby on Rails apps](https://railsnotesui.xyz/email-templates), plus the newly-released [Ruby on Rails Starter Kit/SaaS template](https://railsnotesui.xyz/starter-kit).

> ⇒ Ruby on Rails, ViewComponents

### [RailsNotes 🟥](https://railsnotes.xyz)

> RailsNotes is a Ruby on Rails blog, the blog I wish I had when I was first learning Rails. I try to write interesting articles that share _tacit knowledge_; As of early 2024 nearly 30,000 people have read the blog (an outrageous success), and I'm excited to keep writing!

> ⇒ NextJS, TailwindCSS, Vercel, Beehiiv (for the newsletter)

### [Buybase 🟣](https://buybase.io)

> Buybase helps indie creators to [sell access to Airtable or Notion databases](https://buybase.io).

> Initially it started as a playground, a small project for me tinker around with, with no plans to launch it.

> Over time though, it developed into quite a handy little tool, which I though others might find useful.

> ⇒ Ruby on Rails, Render, Vue, TailwindCSS

### [Jobly 🔶](https://jobly.so)

> Jobly helps companies to [manage their hiring and careers website in Notion](https://jobly.so).

> It's built on-top of Notion, and is two separate NextJS apps (marketing site and main app), both hosted on Vercel.

> Jobly is currently under development! If you're interested, please check it out or email me for more information.

> Like most of my other projects, I decided to sunset Jobly before it really went anywhere.

> ⇒ NextJS, Vercel, Notion, react-notion, Splitbee

### [Sponsaurus 🦕](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/sponsaurus-app)

> Sponsaurus was a advertising management system, for on people who ran or managed email newsletters.

> I worked on it for a few months, and had a few early users, but didn't end up launching it publicly.

> The software is split across two repositories — one for the [Sponsaurus app/backend](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/sponsaurus-app), and another for the [Sponsaurus marketing site](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/sponsaurus-landing)

> The marketing site is a static site generated with Middleman, and I heavily utilized TailwindUI components to speed up development. The main app is a Ruby on Rails app, with all the frontend and backend code managed there.

> This was the first time I used [Render](https://render.com) for hosting (I decided to move on from Heroku).

> ⇒ _Ruby, Ruby on Rails, TailwindCSS, Middleman, Render_

### [JGen 📔](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/JGen)

> JGen is a Python script to generate text-based journal files from a template.

> Given a template, built using a set of simple templating options, JGen can generate a text-based journal of arbitrary length, automatically filling in dates, days/weeks of the year etc.

> I find a simple text journal kept on my computer quite useful, and so I built JGen to help me generate templates for my journals. I added some extra functionality to make it more broadly useful.

> ⇒ _Python3, Regex_

### [Clipprs ✂️](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/clipprs)

> Clipprs is a piece of software I developed to track all the little bits of information that we collect about the people we meet.

> It provides a central repository to store and retrieve nitty-gritty information that our brains are so good at forgetting.

> Clipprs is focused on minimizing the friction between encountering new information and storing it.

> ⇒ _NodeJS, [Oclif](https://www.oclif.io), [Enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer)_

### [LibgenAPI 📚](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/libgen-api)

> [Library Genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/) is a search engine for a wide collection of books and articles. It enables free access to this content where it would otherwise be paywalled or inaccessible.

> As part of a project, I was looking to access results from Library Genesis using an API. Unfortunately, there was (and still is) [no 1st party API](http://garbage.world/posts/libgen/?ref=public-apis) methods for searching by titles or authors, and I had reliability issues with other open-source solutions. I had access to one of the largest "libraries" in the world, but had no reliable way to search it!

> I decided to implement my own API. It solves the core problem of wanting a simple was to search for titles and authors. It is currently a [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/libgen-api/) and uses [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape and parse data from Library Genesis search results.

> ⇒ _Python3, [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)_

### [Personal Site](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/personal_site)

> My personal website was built using Middleman, a ruby-based static site generator, and a combination of ERB and Markdown templates.

> More details [here](stack).

> ⇒ _Ruby, [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), [ERB](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_template_erb.html), Markdown_
