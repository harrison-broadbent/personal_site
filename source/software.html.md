### [Python LibGen Library](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/libgen-api)

> [Library Genesis](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/) is a search engine for a wide collection of books and articles and enables free access to this content where it would otherwise be paywalled or inaccessible.

> As part of a project, I was looking to access results from Library Genesis using an API and then to manipulate that data using Python. Unfortunately, there was (and still is) [no 1st party API](http://garbage.world/posts/libgen/?ref=public-apis) methods for searching by titles or authors, and I had reliability issues with other open-source solutions. I had access to one of, if not the, largest "library" in the world, yet had no reliable way of searching beyond manually visiting the site!

> Therefore I decided to implement my own library for searching Library Genesis. It is definitely a WIP, however, it still solves the core issue of reliably searching Library Genesis better than other solutions I tested. It is currently a [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/libgen-api/) and uses [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to scrape and parse data from Library Genesis search results.

### [Personal Site](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/personal_site)

> My personal website was built using Middleman, a ruby-based static site generator, and a combination of ERB and Markdown templates.
