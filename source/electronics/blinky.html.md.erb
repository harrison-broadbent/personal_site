Blinky was my first attempt at creating a freeform electronics sculpture. 

### Form
I designed Blinky to be minimal. 

The sculpture is split into 2 main sections, the 'head' and 'body', joined by a small wire neck. 
Another wire runs from the base and into the Arduino microcontroller to provide power. 
 
### Function

Blinky has 2 states - sleeping, and awake. 
An MPU6050 module detects changes in force on the sculpture, and when it detects a bump, Blinky will 'wake up'. 
It will 'fall asleep' again if it's ignored for a bit. 

When he's awake, Blinky cycles through different expressions. These include blinking, looking around, or whirling his mouth. 
When he falls asleep, Blinky chooses between a static sleeping expression and a snoring animation. 

A moving mean average filters the output from the MPG 6050. 

A 75 sample mean determines a rolling average, and then the program takes 2 samples from this.  

There is a micro-USB port powering this sculpture, at the back of the wooden base. 

The full source code for this project is available here - [blinky source code](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/blinky).

### Parts

Key components of the sculpture are - 

- Arduino Pro Mini + FTDI USB Programmer.
- 7 segment display.
- MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer.
- Wooden base (a recycled candle lid).
- Enameled copper wire (bad idea. avoid enamel).
