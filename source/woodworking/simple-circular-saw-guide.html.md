Having jumped headfirst into woodworking, the first thing I wanted to build was a jig from [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCnCP1hdg9g). It's a right-angle circular saw jig (the first one in the video) â€” you just rest it up against a piece to give you a nice square cut (if you've built it square!).

Here's the drawing:

The two pieces of wood can be held together with just PVA wood glue, but I added a couple of screws too. Here's what it looks like in real life:

Make sure you use a square to align the two boards! The jig is pretty useless if it's not square ðŸ˜… You don't have to be too precise with the width of the bottom board though â€” you can make it a bit wider than it needs to be on the circular saw side, and just trim it to size with your first cut.

Overall it works well!

> Note: Adapt this jig to your tools! Make sure everything will fit and have clearance.

> Initially I built this with two 18mm pieces of wood, which blocked the saw from sliding due to a part of the saw protruding on the left side. Make sure you're building a jig for _your_ tool and not just copying me blindly!
