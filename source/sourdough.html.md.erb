# Sourdough

Recently, I've been getting into sourdough baking.

Below are some short posts I've written summarizing some of the things i've learnt along the way — 

<%= partial 'partials/folder-list', :locals => { path: "sourdough"} %>

<div class="gallery-padding-top">
	<p>Some unsolicited bread pics: </p>
	<%= partial("partials/image-gallery", :locals => { :path => "images/sourdough/main/", :unsplash_link => false})%>
</div>
