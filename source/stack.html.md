# Stack

I love reading about the technology stacks other people use when they build things.
Currently, this site runs on the following (source available on [Github](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/personal_site)) -

- [Middleman](https://www.middlemanapp.com/) static site generator.
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to create webpages, parsed by Middleman using [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown).
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for automated cloud deployment.
- Design _shamelessly inspired_ by [Patrick Collison's](https://www.patrickcollison.com) personal site.
