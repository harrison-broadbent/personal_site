# Stack

I love learning how other people build things.
Currently, this site runs on the following (using an [open-source blog template](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/ruby-middleman-tailwind-starter-blog) I built) -

- [Middleman](https://www.middlemanapp.com/) static site generator,
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for most of the styling,
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to create webpages, parsed by Middleman using [kramdown](https://github.com/gettalong/kramdown),
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for static hosting.
- Design _shamelessly inspired_ by [Patrick Collison's personal site.](https://www.patrickcollison.com)

> I've used this tech stack for 8+ years now to run this site. Do I think Middleman is dying? Absolutely. I still enjoy using it though, and I think it's still a solid choice for a static site like this.

> I think `.md` is the ultimate blog file format. There's no lock-in to a CMS platform, and they're entirely portable to another platform. Middleman, despite it's age, does a great job of parsing and rendering everything, but if I wanted to switch to another stack, I could just copy-and-paste my `.md` articles across with no fuss.
