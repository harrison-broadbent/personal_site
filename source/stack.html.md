# Stack

I love reading about the technology stacks other people use when they build things.
Currently, this site runs on the following (source avaliable on [github](https://github.com/harrison-broadbent/personal_site)) -

- [Middleman](https://www.middlemanapp.com/) static site generator.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) cloud deployment.
- [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to create webpages, parsed by Middleman using the [redcarpet](https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet) markdown engine.
