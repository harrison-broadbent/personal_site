![photo-of-harrison](images/profile.jpg){:class="max-h-32"}

I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I currently work at [HotDoc](https://hotdoc.com.au) and run the [RailsNotes blog](https://railsnotes.xyz). You can learn more at [/now](/now.html).

Before HotDoc, I built payments systems at an Indonesian tech unicorn, and spent 3 years working at [Seer Medical](https://seermedical.com), in a strange (but fun!) mix of manufacturing / production management / software engineering.

I particularly enjoy [coding](software), [reading](reading), running, [electronics](electronics) and camping. Recently, I've also been getting into [sourdough baking](sourdough) and [woodworking](woodworking).
