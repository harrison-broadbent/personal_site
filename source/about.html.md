# About

![photo-of-harrison](images/profile.jpg){:class="hero-img-small"}

I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I'm currently working as a software engineer at Bukalapak, and building [MONN.APP](https://monn.app) on the side.

Previously, I spent 3 years working in MedTech at [Seer Medical](https://seermedical.com), in a bit of a strange (but fun!) mix of manufacturing / production management / software engineering roles.

I particularly enjoy [coding](software), [reading](reading), [running](running), [electronics](electronics) and camping. Recently, I've also been getting into [sourdough baking](sourdough).
