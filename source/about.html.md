Hey, my name's Harrison. I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [HotDoc](https://hotdoc.com.au), Australia's largest medical bookings platform. Prior to this, I built payment systems at an Indonesian tech unicorn, and blended software engineering with device manufacturing at a local MedTech startup.

Some of my hobbies are [reading](reading), [electronics](electronics), [sourdough baking](sourdough), marathon running and camping. Recently, I've also been exploring [woodworking](woodworking) and [writing about dumbphones](https://dumbph.com).

Learn more about what I'm current up to at [/now](/now.html).
