# About

![photo-of-harrison](images/profile.jpg){:class="hero-img-small"}

I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I currently work at [HotDoc](https://hotdoc.com.au), and blog at [RailsNotes](https://railsnotes.xyz) in my spare time. You can learn more at [/now](/now.html).

Before HotDoc, I spent 6 months building payments systems at an Indonesian tech unicorn, and 3 years working in MedTech at [Seer Medical](https://seermedical.com), in a bit of a strange (but fun!) mix of manufacturing / production management / software engineering.

I particularly enjoy [coding](software), [reading](reading), [running](running), [electronics](electronics) and camping. Recently, I've also been getting into [sourdough baking](sourdough).
