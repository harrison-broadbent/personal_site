Hey, my name's Harrison. I live in Melbourne, Australia.

I currently work at [HotDoc](https://hotdoc.com.au) and run the [RailsNotes blog](https://railsnotes.xyz) (learn more at [/now](/now.html)). Before HotDoc, I built payments systems at an Indonesian tech unicorn, and spent 3 years working at [Seer Medical](https://seermedical.com), in a strange (but fun!) mix of manufacturing / production management / software engineering.

I particularly enjoy coding, [reading](reading), running, [electronics](electronics), camping and [sourdough baking](sourdough). Recently, I've also been doing some [woodworking](woodworking) and [writing about dumbphones](https://dumbph.com).
