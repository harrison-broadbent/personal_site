I was nine years old when I dove headfirst into the vast expanse of AlagaÃ«sia.  
From the first page, I was hooked. Spellbound (ðŸ˜Š) even, by the rich and vast world, the thrilling plot and the sheer depth of Paolini's writing. 
The continent of magic, dragons, elves and dwarves was like nothing I had experienced before, and it left a lasting impression on me as I devoured first Eragon, then the rest of the series â€” Eldest, Brisingr and Inheritance â€” in quick succession. 


Returning to the Inheritance cycle nine years later, with fond, if hazy memories and a solid helping of nostalgia, I was once again awed by the depths within.  
While, unsurprisingly, the story itself had remained the same over the years, my interpretations had undoubtedly shifted, reflecting the changes and growth in my own life during the intervening years.  

Again, I was drawn into the world so painstakingly crafted by Paolini, rejoicing at the opportunity to be re-introduced to the world and it's inhabitants, with only faint inklings from my previous journey to guide me. 
Despite the ravages of time on my recollection of the story, as is almost always the case reading through the novels a second time revealed many previously hidden things to me, and with some foresight into the later events of the books, I was able to see some of the characters and their actions in a new perspective.  


One thing that didn't change, however, was the anguish I felt as the journey came to a close. The pain I shared with the main character, as they are compelled by their sense of duty and fate to leave behind everything they know â€” their home, their family, and their beloved â€” for lands unknown. My deep sadness as the series came to an all-too-soon closing. Hot tears falling on these final pages as I read, almost touching the outlines of those left there nine years earlier. Perhaps, all these years later, I hadn't changed that much after all. 

To me, the Inheritance cycle is more than just a series of books. The world contained within seems so alive at times that it's hard to believe that it's a work of fiction and not out there somewhere, waiting to be discovered. 
Reading through these books helps me to understand myself better, and returning to these books has shown me how I've grown over the years, and the many ways in which I have remained the same. 

While of course not without imperfections, these books and the characters within hold a special place in my heart. 
I am sure that without these books I would not be the person I am today, if only in small ways, and it's with these thoughts in mind that I write this, and with these thoughts in mind that I encourage you to discover these books, and the world within, for yourself. 

*Atra du evarÃ­nya ono varda.*  
*May the stars watch over you.*
